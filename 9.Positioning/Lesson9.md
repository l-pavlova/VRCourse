# Positioning
## VR/AR zone
- have a further reach than just the screen
- upon movement of the screen the thing becomes visible
- Orientation: DOF(degrees of freedom) - desirably 3, rotation by 3 directives
- Position: DOF(degrees of freedom) - desirably 3, momvement by 3 directives
- With interactive devices each can have 6 or more DOF

## Types of positioning
- Absolute: fixed according to a global coordinate system(e.g. earth), shared between all objects in the virtual scene
- Relative: each object has its own virtual scene, the orientation and the movement in one of them, doesn't affect the rest

## Sensors
- Accelerometer - acceleration on all three axes
- Gyroscope - rotation in space
- Magnetic sensor - orientation to the magnetic field
- Barometer - atmospheric pressure and altitude

## GPS(Global Positioning System)
- navigation via a system of satellites
